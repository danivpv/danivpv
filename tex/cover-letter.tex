Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to submit my application for a AI Engineering role
that challenges me both technically and in terms of leadership.
Building on my extensive background in AI/ML, I have recently 
reskilled into fullstack software development with React and Next.js complimenting existing skillset.

Furthermore, my hands-on experience in AI/ML encompasses the development and refinement
of machine learning models and the deployment of scalable ML systems.
In addition, I have actively pursued fullstack development by consuming 
official documentation and engaging in self-driven projects,
which led me to my current role as Founder and AI Engineer at MXAI,
where I have successfully developed and deployed AI-powered solutions (demos).
During this time, I have overcome challenges and solved problems 
by integrating a variety of services.
Additionally, in previous roles I encountered OOP codebases 
utilizing various design patterns and best practices,
where I was responsible for implementing a variety of tasks and features 
including designing data models, orchestrating ETL pipelines, 
implementing ML algorithms and 
UI interfaces with or without 
CRUD operations.

Driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to excellence, 
I am eager to transition into a role that blends software development 
with product ownership and strategic leadership.
My experiences—ranging from leading product demos at MXAI to 
collaborating with agile teams at Kuona and Entropía AI—have equipped 
me with valuable insights into end-to-end product development.
I have successfully navigated complex system integrations, 
implemented pioneering AI solutions, and managed projects that 
balanced technical demands with business objectives.
I am excited about the prospect of harnessing AI to drive product 
features from concept to deployment while fostering cross-functional 
collaboration and guiding teams toward success.

As a bilingual professional with a C1 level in English, 
I have effectively led customer sales meetings, demo 
presentations and agile team meetings in english and spanish. I am enthusiastic 
about collaborating closely in technical teams to deploy solutions 
to production and maintain quality through comprehensive test 
cases and real-time monitoring.

Thank you for considering my application.
I am confident that my blend of AI/ML expertise, 
fullstack development skills, and ownership/leadership
aligns well with the forward-thinking vision of your team.
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my 
technical capabilities and strategic aspirations can 
contribute to continued success.

Sincerely,
\makeletterclosing
