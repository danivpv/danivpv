\makelettertitle

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Scientist position at QuantumBlack. 
With a robust background in AI/data science based on solid academic foundations and 
recent upskilling in full-stack development, 
I am eager to contribute to drive impact through cross-disciplinary collaboration.

During my tenure at Kuona, I collaborated closely with business teams to develop 
revenue management solutions, ensuring that our models not only met technical standards 
but also aligned with business objectives. At Entropía AI, I worked alongside law 
professionals to ensure our models were rigorously designed and effectively consumed 
by end users, highlighting my ability to bridge technical and non-technical domains.

My academic achievements, including a full scholarship for my Bachelor of Science in 
Artificial Intelligence at Groningen University, underscore my commitment to excellence. 
My Master of Science in Mathematics from UNAM-IIMAS has provided me with a solid foundation 
in developing both contemporary and traditional machine learning models. Additionally, 
my publication on "Turing Patterns in Networks" in the Journal of Complex Sciences 
demonstrates my ability to contribute to academic discourse innovating through the 
application of known theories to novel domains.

Technically, I have been involved in various stages of data science modeling. 
At Entropía, I orchestrated ETL processes using Airflow into MongoDB. 
At Kuona, I engaged in feature engineering and model validation using both SQL and 
NoSQL datasets, and I deployed batch ML systems on AWS, showcasing my end-to-end 
project capabilities.

Finally, about the gap in my professional experience, I had a significant back 
injury last year that forced me to take a three-month break to focus on recovery. 
This period of adversity became a catalyst for growth, allowing me to upskill 
in full-stack development and machine learning engineering using AI coding tools. 
Now, as a more experienced and resilient professional, I am eager to contribute 
to your team by leveraging my skills in data science, machine learning, 
in cross-disciplinary collaborations.

I am excited about the opportunity to work in a multidisciplinary environment at 
QuantumBlack, where I can apply my skills to solve real-world problems and 
contribute to impactful projects. I look forward to the possibility of discussing 
how I can contribute to your team.

Warm regards,
