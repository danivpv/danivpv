Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Customer Engineer, 
AI/ML position at Google Cloud. With a robust background in 
AI/ML and cloud technologies, I am eager to contribute to Google 
Cloud's mission of digitally transforming businesses and industries.

In my current role as Founder and AI Engineer at MXAI, I have 
successfully developed and deployed AI-powered solutions using 
AWS Lambda, Redis, and event-driven architectures, akin to some of the 
Google Cloud services. My experience with RNNs and batch ML systems 
with my previous employer Kuona, 
coupled with the design of FastAPI microservices for model deployment, 
has honed my ability to create scalable cloud solutions.

During my master's studies, I crafted a custom training algorithm using 
the extended Kalman filter, which deepened my understanding ML training 
nuances. Besides coursework, books, projects, and a deep 
passion for ML and LLMs, has led me to 
develop cutting edge understanding of modern ML techniques such as 
Transformers, more generally Graph Neural Networks, Physics Informed 
Neural Networks and LLMs, as showcased on my GitHub and Hugging Face 
profiles. I cannot thank enought the authors of books such as 
"Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow 
and "LLM Engineer's Guideline" by Maxime Labonne et. al. for their 
contributions to education in Deep Learning and MLOps/LLOps best 
practices respectively.

As a bilingual professional with a C1 level in English, 
I have effectively led customer sales meetings and demo 
presentations at MXAI. I am enthusiastic about bringing my customer 
engagement skills to Google Cloud and benefiting from the 
training and structure of a leading tech company.

I am particularly proud of my innovative solutions at Kuona, 
where I proposed using QLora for model fine-tuning and custom 
loss functions to enhance business KPIs. At Entropía AI, I 
spearheaded the development of RAG pipelines, significantly 
improving accuracy in QA benchmarks for legal and academic 
datasets which were critical 
for the clients trust and adoption of our solutions.

I am excited about the opportunity to join Google Cloud and 
contribute to its success by leveraging my expertise in AI/ML 
and cloud technologies. Thank you for considering my application. 
I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can 
contribute to your team.

Sincerely,
\makeletterclosing
